 * Observed on the runtime (2026-10-07 captures):
 * - Our message is echoed as a `user_message` stream event carrying our `otid`
 *   and the `run_id` it started. Other inputs (task notifications) are echoed
 *   with their own otid.
 * - Continuation runs (after a client tool) have no echo but appear in
 *   `loop_status.activeRunIds`. Background subagent runs stream into the same
 *   session but never appear there.
 * - A foreign run's `result` can consume the SDK's turn; our own run then
 *   finishes with no result, only `loop_status` back at WAITING_ON_INPUT.
 *
 * Until the runtime shows it reports runs (any echo with a run id, or any
 * `loop_status`), the tracker passes everything through, so runtimes without
 * them behave as before.
